        <p>
          I was born and raised in Detroit, MI by my very Jamaican parents.
          Being the first first-generation child of my parents, the love for
          learning was instilled in me from day one (along with a set of
          superstitious beliefs that will either intrigue you or make you
          question my judgement). Along with learning, I love most things
          science fiction, anime, my offbeat humor, and naps. I'm currently
          enrolled in Perficient's Bright Paths program and hope to transition
          from an IT support role to a software engineering role. After securing
          a software engineering role, I would love to pay it forward by
          mentoring other non-traditional candidates that want to break into
          tech.

        <h2>A Smigden Of The Things I Love</h2>

          I've already listed a few of the things that I enjoy above, but I'd
          like to share a few more. In no particular order, here are some things
          that I enjoy doing in my spare time:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Watching anything edutainment on YouTube. My favorites are SciShow,
            TED Ed, and America's Test Kicthen.
          </li>
          <li>Traveling when I have the time and the funds.</li>
          <li>
            Reading (more like listening to...Hey, Audible) books on
            self-improvement, fanstay, or whatever looks interesting while
            browsing for a new read.
          </li>
        </ul>
